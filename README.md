# siivalinker
Link SiIvaGunner videos to their corresponding SiIvaGunner wiki article

# How to use
Import or paste the .user.js file into your favourite Monkey extension. Whenever you see a [SiIvaGunner video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlmDPC6ai4Y) on Youtube, it'll put a link next to the title, and you can middle-click to open it in a new tab at your leisure.

# Notes
If your OS or browser is too old the link may appear to be a bunch of squares. Should still be fine though.
